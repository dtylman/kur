## Jira Project Management Graph

[Kur](https://www.mifologia.com/myths/sumerian-myths/the-slaying-of-the-dragon-kur/) a primeval, monstrous creature, often described as a serpent or dragon. This creature is sometimes associated with chaos and is depicted as being defeated by various gods, such as Enki or Ninurta. This monstrous Kur is said to have lived in the empty space between the primal sea and the earth's crust, and its defeat sometimes results in major cosmic changes, such as the regulation of waters.

Kur embodies the perfect metaphor for your situation as an architect managing projects you don't fully control. Just like the ancient hero Ninurta had to battle this chaotic dragon that disrupted order, your project management system named "Kur" would be about taming the chaos of uncontrolled projects, bringing structure to the "underworld" of complex architectural challenges, and establishing order in the "great below" of project management chaos.
